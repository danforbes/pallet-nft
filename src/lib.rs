//! # Unique Assets Implementation: Commodities
//!
//! This pallet exposes capabilities for managing unique assets, also known as
//! non-fungible tokens (NFTs).
//!
//! - [`pallet_commodities::Trait`](./trait.Trait.html)
//! - [`Calls`](./enum.Call.html)
//! - [`Errors`](./enum.Error.html)
//! - [`Events`](./enum.RawEvent.html)
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! Assets that share a common metadata structure may be created and distributed
//! by an asset admin. Asset owners may burn assets or transfer their
//! ownership. Configuration parameters are used to limit the total number of a
//! type of asset that may exist as well as the number that any one account may
//! own. Assets are uniquely identified by the hash of the info that defines
//! them, as calculated by the runtime system's hashing algorithm.
//!
//! This pallet implements the [`UniqueAssets`](./nft/trait.UniqueAssets.html)
//! trait in a way that is optimized for assets that are expected to be traded
//! frequently.
//!
//! ### Dispatchable Functions
//!
//! * [`mint`](./enum.Call.html#variant.mint) - Use the provided commodity info
//!   to create a new commodity for the specified user. May only be called by
//!   the commodity admin.
//!
//! * [`burn`](./enum.Call.html#variant.burn) - Destroy a commodity. May only be
//!   called by commodity owner.
//!
//! * [`transfer`](./enum.Call.html#variant.transfer) - Transfer ownership of
//!   a commodity to another account. May only be called by current commodity
//!   owner.
