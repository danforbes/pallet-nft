//! # Unique Assets Interface
//!
//! This trait describes an abstraction over a set of unique assets, also known as non-fungible
//! tokens (NFTs).
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! Unique assets have an owner, identified by an account ID, and are defined by a common set of
//! attributes (the asset info type). An asset ID type distinguishes unique assets from one another.
//! Assets may be created (minted), destroyed (burned) or transferred.
//!
//! This abstraction is implemented by [pallet_commodities::Module](../struct.Module.html).
